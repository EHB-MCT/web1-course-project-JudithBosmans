                    <h2>Drawing</h2>
                    <p>Have been drawing since i was little. Attended art school for 4 years. Decided I didn't want to
                        pursue it professionally and kept it as a hobby.</p>

                    <h2>Reading</h2>
                    <p>Have also been reading since I was a kid. It is a nice form of relaxation and break from the
                        digital world.</p>

                    <h2>Running</h2>
                    <p>Started running with the first corona lockdown and just kept it up. It helps clear my mind and
                        the exercise makes you feel better.</p>

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>I think everyone likes good music and I am no exception. I like all kinds of genres but listen to
                        hip-hop and rap most often. I also really enjoy classical music and lofi.</p>

                        time favorite games are read dead redemption 2, breath of the wild and Minecraft.</p>
